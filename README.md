# Wikipedia Birthday Python Search
Say, hypothetically, a person makes a claim that birthdays, specifically months, influence the behavior and character of an individual. They agree that a good way to test this would be to retrieve the birthdays of people that belong to a reasonably well defined category and see if a pattern arises with the dates.
Enter leveraging Wikipedia data with python code. 
This repo contains a short script that searches Wikipedia for committers of violent crime and gets their birthdays. Those birthdays can later be used to perform an analysis on whether a relationship exists between the birthdays or not. (There is none according to this data)
